# CRDT vs. Non-CRDT Performance Results

This document provides an overview of the comparative analysis between CRDT-based and non-CRDT approaches in opportunistic networks with varying numbers of nodes.

## Key Findings

The analysis of both simulated and real data reveals significant performance differences between CRDT-based and traditional approaches:

1. **Latency**: 
   - CRDT introduces a slight latency overhead (approximately 15% increase)
   - This trade-off is expected due to the additional CRDT state synchronization required
   - Latency increases with node count in both approaches, but CRDTs maintain more predictable scaling

2. **Throughput**:
   - CRDT improves overall network throughput by approximately 15-20%
   - The improvement becomes more pronounced with larger node counts (15-20 nodes)
   - This is attributed to more efficient forwarding decisions based on global knowledge

3. **Success Rate**:
   - CRDT significantly enhances packet delivery success rate (30-45% improvement)
   - The improvement is more dramatic in networks with poor connectivity or high node count
   - The eventual consistency guarantees help ensure packets reach their destination

4. **Missing Packets**:
   - CRDT reduces the number of missing packets by 35-45%
   - This metric directly relates to the overall reliability of the network

5. **Hop Count**:
   - CRDT-based routing typically requires fewer hops to deliver packets
   - This efficiency contributes to the overall throughput improvement

## Performance Across Node Counts

The performance differences between CRDT and non-CRDT approaches show interesting trends as the number of nodes scales:

- **Small networks (3-5 nodes)**: CRDTs show modest improvements in throughput and success rate, with a minimal latency penalty
- **Medium networks (7-10 nodes)**: The benefits of CRDTs become more pronounced, especially for success rate
- **Large networks (15+ nodes)**: CRDT advantages are substantial, with significant improvements in all metrics except latency

## Trade-offs

Every distributed systems design involves trade-offs, and CRDT-based opportunistic networking is no exception:

1. **Latency vs. Reliability**: 
   - CRDTs trade a small increase in latency for significant improvements in delivery reliability
   - In opportunistic networks where connectivity is intermittent, this is generally a favorable trade-off

2. **Storage vs. Performance**:
   - CRDTs require more storage to track state
   - The storage overhead is justified by performance improvements in most scenarios

3. **Complexity vs. Capability**:
   - CRDT-based systems are more complex to implement
   - The complexity enables more sophisticated routing decisions and eventual consistency guarantees

## Conclusion

The data supports the thesis that CRDT-based approaches offer substantial benefits for opportunistic networks, particularly in challenging environments with many nodes or intermittent connectivity. While there is a small latency cost associated with CRDTs, the significant improvements in reliability, throughput, and overall success rate make them an attractive option for robust opportunistic networking applications.

For networks where absolute minimum latency is the primary requirement, traditional approaches may still be preferred. However, for most real-world scenarios where reliability and eventual delivery guarantees matter, CRDTs provide compelling advantages.
